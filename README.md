# To-Do-List

This is a To-do List application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively.
The app provides functionality to add, edit, mark as complete and delete tasks.It uses a backend server powered by Node.js, Express.js and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

It contains the following features:
-Add Task: Add new tasks to my to do list
-Mark as Complete: Click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will be visually crossed out.

I have used the following technologies:

*Front-end:
-HTML
-CSS 
-JavaScript (to interact with the backend)

*Back-end:
-Node.js
-Express.js(to handle API requests and manage tasks)
